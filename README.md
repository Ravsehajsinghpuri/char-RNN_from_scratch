# char-RNN_from_scratch
This repository describes my first try creating an char-RNN from scratch using numPy library in Python.
The RNN is trained on the text which is loaded to the input.txt file which currently contains text from my LinkedIn profile.
You can replace the text in the input.txt file with your own and try this out.
This char-RNN predicts the next character given the previous character in the text. So, if first character of the text is provided as an input to the trained char-RNN, it will spit out the whole text by predicting char by char in sequence which was provided during training time.
